Q.What is JWT?
A. Json Web Token used for encoding and securely transmitting info.This info can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed
https://jwt.io/introduction/

Q.How is it implemented here?

We are  doing is that with user IDs.(user.py)
So a user is going to be an entity
that has a unique identifying number
and a username and a password.
The user is going to send us a username and a password,
and we're going to send them, the client really,
a JWT and that JWT is going to be the user ID.
When the client has the JWT
they can send it to us with any request they make
and when they do that it's going to tell us
that they have previously authenticated,
that means they are logged in.

Q What are Requirements for Encryption?

We need some sort of key for encryption,that is done by
app.secret_key="ANY_SECRET_KEY".
For production API,this has to be hidden

Q userid_mapping:

maps user id with the user details. Example:
userid_mapping={
1:
{
'id':1,
'username':'harry',
'password':'potter'}
}
in code we are representing as user objects instead of json

Q Authenticate function:

takes username,password
gets user using user_mapping
if passwords match, returns userNone as default

Q identity function

extracts userid from payload
used to retrieve users

Q using jwt in app.py

from secrity.py we import identity , authentication
jwt creates a new endpoint /auth
when we call /auth , jwt sends it to authentication function
after authentication we return user.
auth endoint return a jwt token
when we send it to next request ,(the jwt token) jwt calls  identity
function which then returns the username that was previously authenticated

Q who creates http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth

Jwt extension creates the endpoint by default
